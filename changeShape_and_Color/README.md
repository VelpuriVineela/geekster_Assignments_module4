# Change Shape and Color

This project is a simple web page that allows you to change the shape and color of a container by clicking buttons. It demonstrates how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive user experiences.

## HTML
The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the following important elements:
- **HTML5 Doctype:** Specifies the document type.
- **`<meta>` Tags:** Define character encoding and viewport settings.
- **`<title>` Tag:** Sets the title of the web page.
- **Container (`<div>`):** A container element with an ID of "container."
- **Shape Box (`<div>`):** A nested `<div>` with an ID of "shapeBox" that will display different shapes.
- **Change Color Button:** A button to change the background color of the container.
- **Change Shape Button:** A button to change the shape of the inner box.

## CSS
The CSS file (`style.css`) defines the styling for the elements. Key CSS properties and classes used include:
- **`*`:** Universal selector for setting margin and box-sizing.
- **`.container`:** Styling for the main container element.
- **Shape Classes:** Classes like `.square`, `.rectangle`, `.circle`, etc., defining shape-specific styles.
- **`.btn` and `.btnFront`:** Styling for the buttons and their front text.
- **`:hover` and `:active` Pseudo-classes:** Define button interactions.

## JavaScript
The JavaScript file (`script.js`) adds interactivity to the web page. It includes:
- Event listeners for the "Change Color" and "Change Shape" buttons.
- Arrays of colors and shapes to choose from randomly.
- Functions to change the background color and shape of the container.

This project showcases the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic user experience where users can change the appearance of a container with a single click.
